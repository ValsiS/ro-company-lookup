# Laravel Boost v2 MCP

## What is Laravel Boost?

Laravel Boost is a Laravel package that runs inside your project and provides a Laravel-aware Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, versioned AI guidelines, and a Laravel ecosystem documentation API. Its goal is to make AI agents behave more like experienced Laravel developers by giving them access to your app's structure and the correct framework docs for your exact versions.

## What "MCP" means in Boost

Boost ships an MCP server that exposes tools an AI agent can call while working in your repo. These tools let the agent inspect and interact with the application, so it can generate code grounded in your real project state.

Common tools include:

- Application info (PHP/Laravel versions, packages, models)
- List routes and Artisan commands
- Read config values and available config keys
- Database schema inspection and database queries
- Read last application errors and browser logs

## What's new in Boost v2

Boost v2 introduces a Skills system for extending and customizing your AI workflow. The v2 release also adds skill synchronization and overrides, a new `boost:add-skill` Artisan command, and a revamped installation experience.

## Skills system (v2) in practice

Skills are small, reusable instruction bundles you can attach to your agent guidelines to handle repeatable workflows. Use them to encode project-specific conventions, tool usage patterns, or step-by-step playbooks.

Typical skill content:

- A short description of when the skill should be used
- The steps an agent should follow
- Constraints or gotchas to avoid regressions

Create a new skill with:

```bash
php artisan boost:add-skill
```

Then reference it from your AI guideline file (for example `AGENTS.md`) so the agent knows when to load it.

## Install / upgrade

Install Boost as a dev dependency and run the installer:

```bash
composer require laravel/boost --dev
php artisan boost:install
```

If you are upgrading to v2, update your dependencies and re-run the installer:

```bash
composer update
php artisan boost:install
```

The installer generates MCP configuration files (for example `.mcp.json`), AI guideline files (such as `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or `junie/`), and a `boost.json` configuration file. These are safe to add to `.gitignore` because they are regenerated by `boost:install` and `boost:update`.

## Agent setup (examples)

- Cursor: open the command palette and enable the `laravel-boost` MCP server in the MCP settings.
- Claude Code: if needed, register Boost with `claude mcp add -s local -t stdio laravel-boost php artisan boost:mcp`.

## Local setup for this repo (package workflow)

This repository is a Laravel package, so Boost is most useful when you run it inside a small Laravel app that consumes the package. A typical local flow:

```bash
# From the parent directory (or anywhere you keep dev apps)
composer create-project laravel/laravel ro-company-lookup-dev
cd ro-company-lookup-dev

# Add this package as a path repository
composer config repositories.local path ../ro-company-lookup
composer require valsis/ro-company-lookup:@dev

# Install Boost and generate MCP config/guidelines
composer require laravel/boost --dev
php artisan boost:install
```

Open the dev app in your editor when using an MCP-capable agent. The MCP server will read the app's routes, config, and database, while still letting you edit the package code in this repo.

## Notes for this repo

Boost is optional and only affects AI-assisted development workflows. It does not change how `ro-company-lookup` works at runtime, but it can improve code generation and debugging when using an MCP-capable agent.
